            <p>
             <strong>Car Wheel Designs</strong><br><br>Car wheel designs encompass various aspects 
              such as size, materials, spoke patterns, and finishes. Here's a breakdown:
            </p>

             <br><br>

            <p>
              <strong>1. Size:</strong> Wheels come in different
              diameters, commonly ranging from 15 to 22 inches,
              with larger sizes often associated with sportier or luxury vehicles.
            </p>

            <P>
                 <strong>2. Materials</strong> Wheels are typically made from aluminum alloy, steel, or carbon fiber. Aluminum alloy wheels are popular due to their
               combination of strength and light weight, enhancing performance and fuel efficiency.
            </P>

            <p>
                 <strong>3. Spoke Patterns</strong> Spokes are the structural elements connecting the wheel's center to its outer edge. There are countless spoke designs, including simple and complex patterns, with variations in number,
                     thickness, and curvature. Common designs include mesh, split-spoke, and multi-spoke patterns.
             </p>
        
            <p>
                <strong>4. Finishes</strong> Wheels can be finished in various ways to achieve different aesthetics 
                  and protection against corrosion. Common finishes include polished, painted, machined, and chrome-plated.
             </p> 

            <p>
                 <strong>5 Offset and Backspacing:</strong>
                  These terms refer to the positioning of the wheel mounting surface relative to the
                 centerline of the wheel. Offset affects the wheel's stance and how it fits within the wheel well, influencing handling characteristics and appearance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Conclusively, wheel design is a combination of engineering considerations, aesthetic
                preferences, and performance requirements tailored to the specific vehicle and the
                 owner's tastes.
            </p>

                COMPONENTS OF WHEELS           
            </h3>

            <br>
            <p>
                The main components of a wheel includes:
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>1. Rim:</strong> The outer circular part of the wheel where the tire is mounted.
                <img src="RIM IMG.webp" alt="tread" style="display: block;" width="160px">
            </p>

            <p>
                 <strong>2. Tire:</strong> The rubber covering that provides traction and cushioning.
                 <img src="mobile_image.png" alt="Sidewall" style="display: block;" width="160px">
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>3. Hub:</strong> The central part of the wheel that mounts to the axle.
                <img src="tire hub.jpg" alt="bead" style="display: block;" width="160px">
           </p>

            <p>
                 <strong>4. Spokes:</strong> Rods or wires connecting the rim to the hub, providing structural support.
                <img src="spoke-wheel.jpg" alt="Carcass" style="display: block;" height="300px">
            </p>

            <p>
                 <strong>5. Axle:</strong> The shaft on which the wheel rotates.
                <img src="axles-1400-1.jpg" alt="axles" style="display: block;" width="160px">
            </p>

            <p>
                 <strong>6. Bearings:</strong> Components that allow the wheel to rotate smoothly around the axle.
                 <img src="hub-bearings.png" alt="hub bearing" style="display: block;" width="160px">
            </p>

             <p>
                 <strong>7. Valve stem:</strong> A small tube for inflating the tire, typically located on the rim.
                 <img src="valve stem.jpg" alt="valve stem" style="display: block;" width="160px">
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>8. WHEEL DISC</strong> This is metallic and can be made of different materials and have different 
                shapes, but basically, it is a tube and the rest of the elements of the wheel are placed on it. These 
                 other elements are attached to it through bolts and nuts.
                 <img src="wheel disc.jpeg" alt="wheel disc" style="display: block;"  width="160px">
            </p>

            <p>
                 <strong>9. COUNTERWEIGHTS</strong> The Counterweights is an element that some people are unaware of but that
                is essential for safe driving. These counterweights are small in size and are usually made of lead. These are 
                placed on the rims and their main purpose is to balance all four wheels and prevent vibrations while driving.
                 Counterweights prevents annoying vibration while driving.

                FUNCTONALITY OF WHEEL IN AUTOMOBILE
            </h3>

            <br>

            <p>
                The car wheel is one of the essential parts of a vehicle. It produces a rotatory function and moves the car 
                 from one point to another. Since their invention, car wheels have changed various designs, styles and structures.  
                The car gets the leverage it needs to move by the wheel, transferring power from the axle and the hub to the tires.
                The larger the wheel is compared to the engine's power, the bigger the leverage and the faster the car moves.         
                Vehicle wheels have the function of carrying the weight of the vehicle and exchanging forces with the road surface 
                to control its path.
