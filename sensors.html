                <strong>- Automatic Climate Control Sensors</strong>
                Automatic climate control sensors are components of a vehicle's HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) system that monitor various environmental factors inside and outside the vehicle to maintain a comfortable cabin temperature automatically. These sensors work together to regulate the temperature, airflow, and other climate control settings based on the preferences of the occupants and the current conditions.

              <h2>
                TYPES OF VOLTAGE SENSORS 
              </h2>

              <p>
                <strong>- Battery Voltage Sensor:</strong>
                Monitors the voltage level of the vehicle's battery. It provides information about the battery's state of charge and health and helps prevent battery overcharging or undercharging, which can affect starting performance and overall battery life.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>- Alternator Voltage Regulator:</strong>
                Regulates the voltage output of the alternator. It ensures that the electrical system receives a steady voltage supply for charging the battery and powering vehicle electronics, also Prevents voltage spikes or drops that could damage sensitive electronic components and ensures consistent electrical system performance.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>- Powertrain Control Module (PCM):</strong>
                Monitors various voltage signals throughout the vehicle. It controls engine and transmission operation based on input from sensors and actuators, it ensures proper engine performance, fuel efficiency, and emissions control by regulating voltage levels to critical engine and transmission components.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>- Oxygen Sensor Heater Voltage Sensor:</strong>
                Monitors voltage supply to the oxygen sensor heater circuit. It ensures that the oxygen sensor reaches operating temperature quickly for accurate emissions control. It is Integrated into the engine control module (ECM) or oxygen sensor control module.This sensor helps maintain optimal engine performance and emissions compliance by ensuring proper operation of the oxygen sensor heater.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>- Voltage Regulator Module:</strong>
                Regulates voltage output to specific vehicle systems or components. It ensures consistent voltage levels to sensitive electronic components such as the engine control module (ECM), transmission control module (TCM), and various sensors. It's located in the vehicle's electrical system, typically near the battery or alternator. This sensor prevents overvoltage or undervoltage conditions that could lead to component damage or system malfunction.
              </p>
