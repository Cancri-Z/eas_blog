                <strong> MECHANISM OF HAND BRAKES</strong>
           </p>

            <p>
                The mechanism of a hand brake can vary depending on the type of vehicle and its braking system. However, in most cases, hand brakes operate using a mechanical linkage system. Here's a general overview of the typical mechanism of a hand brake:
           </p> 

            <br>

            <p>
               <strong> 1. Hand Brake Lever:</strong>
               The hand brake lever is the visible part of the mechanism inside the vehicle. It is usually located between the front seats, either on the center console or mounted on the floor. When the lever is pulled or engaged, it activates the hand brake system.
              <img src="hand_brake_lever-removebg-preview.png" alt="hand brake lever" style="display: block;">
           </p>

            <p>
                <strong>2. Cables:</strong>
                The hand brake lever is connected to a set of steel cables or rods that run underneath the vehicle. These cables transmit the force applied by the lever to the rear brakes.
                <img src="handbrake_cable-removebg-preview.png" alt="hand brake cable" style="display: block;">
           </p>

           <p>
               <strong>3. Equalizer or Lever Mechanism:</strong>
               Near the rear wheels, the cables are connected to an equalizer or lever mechanism. This component ensures that the force from the hand brake lever is distributed evenly to both rear wheels.
              <img src="hand_braker_equilizer-removebg-preview.png" alt="hand brake equilizer" style="display: block;">
           </p>

           <p>
              <strong>4. Brake Shoes or Calipers:</strong>
               In vehicles with drum brakes, the hand brake mechanism activates brake shoes inside the brake drums attached to the rear wheels. When the hand brake is engaged, the brake shoes press against the inside of the drum, creating friction and stopping the rotation of the wheels.
              <img src="brake_shoe.png" alt="brake shoe" style="display: block;">
            </p>

           <p>
              <strong> 5. Release Mechanism:</strong>
              To release the hand brake, there is usually a button or lever mechanism near the hand brake lever that disengages the brake system when pressed or released. This allows the cables to slacken, releasing the tension on the brake shoes or calipers.
              <img src="hand_brake_release_mechanism-removebg-preview.png" alt="hand brake release mechanism" style="display: block;">
           </p>

            <p>
               <strong> 6. Adjustment Mechanism:</strong>
               Hand brakes typically have an adjustment mechanism to ensure that they engage and disengage properly. This mechanism may involve adjusting the tension of the cables or the position of the brake shoes or calipers.
              <img src="hannd_brake_adjustment-removebg-preview.png" alt="hand brake adjustment" style="display: block;">
           </p>

           <p>
              In vehicles equipped with disc brakes, the hand brake mechanism activates calipers that squeeze brake pads against a disc rotor attached to the rear wheels, achieving the same braking effect.
              <img src="" alt="" style="display: block;">
            </p>
