          <p>
             An oil filter is a crucial component of a vehicle's engine system. Its primary function is to remove contaminants and impurities from the engine oil, ensuring that the oil remains clean and effective in lubricating the engine parts. Over time, as oil circulates through the engine, it picks up dirt, metal particles, and other debris. If these contaminants aren't removed, they can cause damage to the engine components and reduce its efficiency.
          </p>

           <p>
              Oil filters typically consist of a metal housing containing various filter media, such as cellulose, synthetic fibers, or a    combination of both. As the oil flows through the filter, these media trap and retain the contaminants, allowing only clean oil to pass through and lubricate the engine.
           </p>

           <p>
              Regularly changing the oil filter, along with the engine oil, is essential for maintaining the health and longevity of the engine. It's typically recommended to replace the oil filter with every oil change, which is usually done every 5,000 to 10,000 miles, depending on the vehicle and driving conditions

            <h3>
                TYPES OF OIL FILTERS 
            </h3>

            <p>
                There are several types of oil filters used in automotive and machinery applications, each with its own design and filtration method. Here are some common types:
           </p>

            <p>
                <strong>1. Mechanical Oil Filters:</strong>  These are the traditional type of oil filters that use a pleated filter media, such as cellulose or synthetic fibers, to trap contaminants as oil passes through. They often have a metal housing and require regular replacement during oil changes.
                <img src="mechanical oil filter.jpeg" alt="mechanical oil filter" style="display: block;" id="knob">
           </p>

            <p>
               <strong>2. Spin-On Oil Filters:</strong> These filters are self-contained units with a metal canister housing that screws onto the engine block. Inside, there's a filter element that traps contaminants. Spin-on filters are convenient to replace since they can be removed and replaced as a single unit.
               <img src="spin oil filter.jpg" alt="spin oil filter" style="display: block;" id="knob">
           </p>

            <p>
               <strong>3. Cartridge Oil Filters:</strong> Unlike spin-on filters, cartridge filters consist of a replaceable filter element contained within a housing. When it's time to change the filter, only the filter element needs replacing, while the housing remains in place. Cartridge filters are common in many modern vehicles.
